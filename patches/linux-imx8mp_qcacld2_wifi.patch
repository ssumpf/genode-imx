This patch is only needed by the 'imx8mp_qcacld2_wifi' driver.

This patch makes 'driver_deferred_probe_enable' accessible from the
outside so that we can set at the appropriate time. This is needed
because the way the 'qcacld-2.0' driver is currently enabled requires
items from the deferred list to be processed even before the late
initcall stage is reach where is type of deferred probing is normally
performed.
